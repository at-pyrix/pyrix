### **✨ Good Looking and Functional UI**
I took inspiration from many sites and interfaces before coming up with this design. Besides, purple is my favourite color anyway :P

### 📱 Responsive Design
I have tested the responsiveness on various devices to provide an (almost) consistent look and feel on various screen sizes.

### **🔎 Article Search Functionality**
The search feature queries the title and the description for a term.

### **🏷️ Categorization of Articles**
This is done manually upon the creation of an article. Helps in the navigating the site much faster. It's specially handy if you've got a bunch of stuff on here.

### **🔖 Save for Later System**
You can bookmark articles for later reading, which is stored in the local storage of your browser.

### **📝 Markdown to HTML Rendering and Styling**
This was made possible thanks to [marked.js](https://github.com/markedjs/marked)

### **⭕ Loading Screen**
Inspired from Reddit.

### **🖼️ Low-quality Placeholders for Images**
To maintain performance and visual appeal, I used placeholder images (provided by Sanity CMS) to optimise load times.

### **✉️ In-Site Contact System:**
You can contact and provide me feedback without having to leave your browser through the contact form.

Makes use of [Formspree](https://formspree.io/)
